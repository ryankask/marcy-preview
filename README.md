marcy
=====

Marcy is an experimental version of [esther](https://github.com/ryankask/esther).
the app the powers my [blog on ryankaskel.com](https://ryankaskel.com/).

It uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and
[ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) to first render the app
server side and then runs normally as a single page web app.

The project is named after the tallest mountain in New York, Mt Marcy, located
in the Adirondack Mountains.
